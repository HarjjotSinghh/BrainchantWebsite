          Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process.
          Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and
          completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our
          response may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly
          infringing material.

        <p>
          If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account
          in response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a
          good faith effort to contact the affected user with information
          concerning the removal or restriction of access.
